##infomations
Before i start, you need to know that i didn't find a lot of time to make this project.
It was difficult with my job and th interviews but i did it.

During the technical interview, someone said to me that you are using slim framework,
so i have choose to use the slim framework for this project.
It was my first time with this Framework, please be aware that i cannot follow all the best practices with my slim experience.

I know that my structure or the way to do things in slim way need to be improved

## If i had more time

* I think that some services need to be refactor like the minMax method ou the isGameOver service.
* I would like also add more test for my services and especially functionnal test.
* I would modify the way that i made the dependency injection on the controllers
because all controllers using the container is using some services and sometimes services that he don't need to use(so this is critical when the application grows)
* Use Monolog and Exceptions.
* Refactor the frontend side (more separete the views -> template, layout and refactor the javascript file-> make javascript object).
* Make a gulp file for minimize, remove unused css or other things. Send ressources/ assets to the public/ folder
* Make a $_SESSION save of the game.
* Make Middlewares.
* Checkstyle verification.
* But especially refactor all my logic because my experience with framework evolve each hours, so each day of work i want to modify some things i have done the days earlier

If you have som advice regarding this project :
* Way of improvments
* Mistake i have Made
* Mistake of Conception
* Mistake regarding Design Pattern
* All that can be useful

Just for you know, a lot of things regarding the front is not made by me because you said that the style of the web interface is irrelevant on your subject file.

PLEASE LET ME KNOW :
